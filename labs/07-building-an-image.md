# Constructing a docker image

Running images others made is useful, but if you want to use docker for your own application,
chances are you want to construct an image on your own.

A [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) is a text file containing a list of
commands that the Docker daemon calls while creating an image. The Dockerfile contains all the
information that Docker needs to know to run the app; a base Docker image to run from, location of
your project code, any dependencies it has, and what commands to run at start-up.

It is a simple way to automate the image creation process. The best part is that the
[commands](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) you write in a Dockerfile are _almost_
identical to their equivalent Linux commands. This means you don't really have to learn new syntax
to create your own Dockerfiles.

## Dockerfile commands summary

Here's a quick summary of some basic commands we will use in our Dockerfile.

> As a rule of thumb, all commands in CAPITAL LETTERS are intended for the docker engine. E.g.

- FROM # base image
- RUN # run a command
- ADD and COPY # copy files into the image
- CMD # run a command at start-up, but can be overridden
- EXPOSE # expose a port
- ENTRYPOINT # run a command at start-up

Details:

- `FROM` is always the first item in the Dockerfile. It is a requirement that the Dockerfile starts
  with the `FROM` command. Images are created in layers, which means you can use another image as
  the base image for your own. The `FROM` command defines your base layer. As argument, it takes
  the name of the image. Optionally, you can add the Docker Hub username of the maintainer and
  image version, in the format `username/imagename:version`.

- `RUN` is used to build up the image you're creating. For each `RUN` command, Docker will run the
  command then create a new layer of the image. This way you can roll back your image to previous
  states easily. The syntax for a `RUN` instruction is to place the full text of the shell command
  after the `RUN` (e.g., `RUN mkdir /user/local/foo`). This will automatically run in a `/bin/sh`
  shell. You can define a different shell like this: `RUN /bin/bash -c 'mkdir /user/local/foo'`

- `COPY` copies local files into the container. The files need to be in the same folder (or a sub
  folder) as the Dockerfile itself. An example is copying the requirements for a python app into
  the container: `COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/`.

- `ADD` should only be used if you want to copy and unpack a tar file into the image. In any other
  case, use `COPY`. `ADD` can also be used to add a file directly from an URL; consider whether
  this is good practice.

- `CMD` defines the commands that will run on the image at start-up. Unlike a `RUN`, this does not
  create a new layer for the image, but simply runs the command. There can only be one `CMD` in a
  Dockerfile. If you need to run multiple commands, the best way to do that is to have the `CMD`
  run a script. `CMD` requires that you tell it where to run the command, unlike `RUN`. So example
  `CMD` commands would be:

```dockerfile
  CMD ["python3", "./app.py"]

  CMD ["/bin/bash", "echo", "Hello World"]
```

- `EXPOSE` creates a hint for users of an image that provides services on ports. It is included in
  the information which can be retrieved via `$ docker inspect <container-id>`.

> **Note:** The `EXPOSE` command does not actually make any ports accessible to the host! Instead,
> this requires publishing ports by means of the `-p` or `-P` flag when using `$ docker run`.

- `ENTRYPOINT` configures a command that will run no matter what the user specifies at runtime.

## Write a Dockerfile

We want to create a Docker image with a Python web app.

As mentioned above, all user images are based on a _base image_. We will build our own Python image
based on [Ubuntu](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/). We'll do that using a **Dockerfile**.

> :bulb: If you want to learn more about Dockerfiles, check out [Best practices for writing
> Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/).

1. We have made a small boilerplate file and app for you in the [/building-an-image](./building-an-image/)
   folder, so head over there and add content to the Dockerfile as described below

   We'll start by specifying our base image, using the `FROM` keyword:

   ```docker
   FROM ubuntu:22.04
   ```

1. The next step is usually to write the commands of copying the files and installing the
   dependencies. But first we will install the Python pip package to the ubuntu linux distribution.
   This will not just install the pip package but any other dependencies too, which includes the
   python interpreter. Add the following [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run)
   commands next:

   ```docker
   RUN apt-get update -y
   RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-dev build-essential
   ```

1. Let's add the files that make up the Flask Application.

   Install all Python requirements for our app to run. This will be accomplished by adding the lines:

   ```docker
   COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
   RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt
   ```

   Copy the application app.py into our image by using the
   [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) command.

   ```docker
   COPY app.py /usr/src/app/

   ```

1. Specify the port number which needs to be exposed. Since our flask app is running on `5000`
   that's what we'll expose.

   ```docker
   EXPOSE 5000
   ```

   > :bulb: The `EXPOSE` instruction does not actually publish the port.
   > It functions as a type of documentation between the person who builds the
   > image and the person who runs the container,
   > about which ports are intended to be published.
   > You need the `-p`/`-P` command to actually open the host ports.

1. The last step is the command for running the application which is simply - `python3 ./app.py`.
   Use the [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) command to do that:

   ```docker
   CMD ["python3", "/usr/src/app/app.py"]
   ```

   The primary purpose of `CMD` is to tell the container which command it should run by default
   when it is started.

1. Verify your Dockerfile.

   Our `Dockerfile` is now ready. This is how the file should look:

   ```docker
   # The base image
   FROM ubuntu:22.04

   # Install python and pip
   RUN apt-get update -y
   RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-dev build-essential

   # Install Python modules needed by the Python app
   COPY requirements.txt /usr/src/app/
   RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r /usr/src/app/requirements.txt

   # Copy files required for the app to run
   COPY app.py /usr/src/app/

   # Declare the port number the container should expose
   EXPOSE 5000

   # Run the application
   CMD ["python3", "/usr/src/app/app.py"]
   ```

### Build the image

Now that you have your `Dockerfile`, you can build your image. The `docker build` command does the
heavy-lifting of creating a docker image from a `Dockerfile`.

The `docker build` command is quite simple - it takes an optional tag name with the `-t` flag, and
the location of the directory containing the `Dockerfile` - the `.` indicates the current directory:

``` bash
docker build -t myfirstapp .
```

Expected output (at the end of the run):

``` bash

If you don't have the `ubuntu:22.04` image, the client will first pull the image and then create
your image. If you do have it, your output on running the command will look different from mine.

If everything went well, your image should be ready! Run `docker image ls` and see if your image
(`myfirstapp`) shows.

When dealing with docker images, a layer, or image layer, is a change on an image. Every time you
run one of the commands RUN, COPY or ADD in your Dockerfile it adds a new layer, causes the image
to change, and makes it possible to roll back to previous states.

We add another layer on top of our starting image, running an update on the system. After that yet
another for installing the python ecosystem.

The concept of layers comes in handy at the time of building images. Because layers are
intermediate images, if you make a change to your Dockerfile, docker will build only the layer that
was changed and reuse the rest.

Each layer is build on top of its parent layer, meaning if the parent layer changes, the next layer
does as well.

If you want to concatenate two layers (e.g. the update and install [which is a good
idea](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#run)), then do
them in the same RUN command.

If you want to be able to use any cached layers from last time, they need to be run _before the
update command_.

> Once we build the layers, Docker will reuse them for new builds. This makes the builds much
> faster. This is great for continuous integration, where we want to build an image at the end of
> each successful build.

Try to move the two `COPY` commands before for the `RUN` and build again to see it taking the
cached layers instead of making new ones.

If you make a `docker ps -a` command, you can now see a container with the name _myfirstapp_ from
the image named _myfirstapp_.

You learned how to write your own docker images in a `Dockerfile` with the use of the `FROM`
command to choose base-images like Alpine or Ubuntu and keywords like `RUN` for executing
commands,`COPY` to copy files, and `CMD` to define the default command.

You also learned that each of the keywords generates an image layer on top of the previous, and
that every one of the layers can be converted to a running container.
