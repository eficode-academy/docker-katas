# Sharing containers

Before we can take our dockerized Flask app to another computer, we need to push it up to the Docker Hub so that we (or other people) can pull it down on other machines.

Docker Hub is sort of like GitHub of Docker images. Itâ€™s the main place people store their Docker images in the cloud.

First, create an account on the Docker Hub if you haven't already - it's free: https://hub.docker.com/account/signup/

Then, login to that account by running the ``docker login`` command on your laptop.

We're almost ready to push our Flask image up to the Docker Hub. We just need to rename it to our namespace first.

Using the ``docker tag`` command, tag the image you created in the previous section to your namespace. For example, I would run:

```bash
sofus@Praq-Sof:/tmp/4$ docker tag myfirstapp praqmasofus/myfirstapp:latest
```

``myfirstapp`` is the tag I used in my ``docker build`` commands in the previous section, and ``praqmasofus/myfirstapp:`` is the full name of the new Docker image I want to push to the Hub.
`praqmasofus` is my username at dockerhub, and also my namespace for all my images.
The `:latest` is a versioning scheme you can append to.

All that's left to do is push up your image:

```bash
sofus@Praq-Sof:/tmp/4$ docker push praqmasofus/myfirstapp
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/praqmasofus/myfirstapp]

```

Go to your profile page on the Docker Hub and you should see your new repository listed: https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/

**Congrats!** You just made your first Docker image and shared it with the world!

Try to pull down the images that your fellows have pushed to see that it's really up there.
