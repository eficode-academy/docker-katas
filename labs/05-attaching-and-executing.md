# Attaching to your container

If you want to go into a container again to execute something you have two options:

- ``attach``  Attach to the specified process running on the container. In our example it is the nginx server.
- ``exec`` Executing another process inside the container. This could be a shell, or a script of some sort.

> NOTE:
> When you attach to an already started container, you cannot exit normally without killing the container unless you issue the attach command like this:
> ``docker container attach --sig-proxy=false CONTAINER`` or by issuing `Ctrl+p Ctrl+q`
> If you issue the `exec` command, you can stop it by `Ctrl+d` or detach yourself by `Ctrl+p Ctrl+q`

First, start up an Nginx container:

```bash
docker container run -d -p 8000:80 nginx
661c6dd59d78b97f8142d67eff6b1d58fbbd42247900241e08f46abdbad19f06
```

Try to attach to the container. Exit it, and browse the webpage again to acknowledge it is gone.

Step into a new container by executing a bash inside the container:

```bash
docker container run -d -p 8000:80 nginx
docker container exec -it CONTAINER bash
```

Inside, we want to run a longer running process, like pinging itself 100 times.
Because containers only have the bare minimum installed, we need to first install ping, and then use it:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install iputils-ping -y
ping 127.0.0.1 -c 100 > /tmp/ping
```

Then detach from the container with `Ctrl+p Ctrl+q` and run the following:

```bash
docker container exec -it CONTAINER bash
tail -f /tmp/ping

```

Here you see that the ping process started in another shell is still running and producing this logfile.
Just stop the process with a `Ctrl+d`.

## Summary

You have tried to `attach` directly to the primary process of a container, as well as starting a new process by the `exec` command. You have also seen how to break out of a container either by terminating the process by `Ctrl+d`, or by detaching from the process by `Ctrl+p Ctrl+q`.
