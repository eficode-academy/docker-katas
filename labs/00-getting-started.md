# Getting started

In this section you will install docker.

## Terminology

Throughout these labs, you will see a lot of Docker-specific jargon which might be confusing to some.
So before you go further, let's clarify some terminology that is used frequently in the Docker ecosystem.

*Docker Container*: An isolated, runnable environment that holds everything needed to run an application.
*Docker Image*: A lightweight, standalone package that contains all necessary code, libraries, and
dependencies to run an application.

- *Docker daemon* - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and
  distributing Docker containers.
- *Docker client* - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the Docker daemon.
- *Docker Hub* - A [docker registry](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) of Docker images. You can
  think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. You'll be using this later
  in this tutorial.

## Installing Docker

Depending on what OS you are running, installation is different, but head over to the
[Get started](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) website and follow the instructions there.
