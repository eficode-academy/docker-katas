# Sharing images

Before we can take our dockerized Flask app to another computer, we need to push it up to Docker Hub
so that publicly avaliable.

Docker Hub is like GitHub for Docker images. Itâ€™s the main place people store their Docker images in
the cloud.

Then, login to that account by running the `docker login` command on your laptop.

We're almost ready to push our Flask image up to the Docker Hub. We just need to rename it to our
namespace (which is the same as our docker username) first.

Using the `docker tag` command, tag the image you created in the previous section to your namespace.
For example, I would run:

```bash
docker tag myfirstapp <your-dockerhub-username>/myfirstapp:latest
```

`myfirstapp` is the tag I used in my `docker build` commands in the previous section, and
`<your-dockerhub-username>/myfirstapp:` is the full name of the new Docker image I want to push to
the Hub. The `:latest` is a versioning scheme you can append to.

All that's left to do is push up your image:

```bash
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/myfirstapp
```

Expected output:

```bash
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/<your-dockerhub-username>/myfirstapp]

Go to your profile page on the Docker Hub and you should see your new repository listed:
[https://hub.docker.com/repos/u/&lt;username&gt;](https://hub.docker.com/repos/u/<username>)

**Congrats!** You just made your first Docker image and shared it with the world!

Try to pull down the images that your fellows have pushed to see that it's really up there.

there.
