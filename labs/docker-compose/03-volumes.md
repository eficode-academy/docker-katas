# Docker volumes

In some cases you're going to need data outside of docker containers and to do that you can use volumes

**A docker Volume** is where you can use a named or unnamed volume to store the external data. You
would normally use a volume driver for this, but you can get a host mounted path using the default
local volume driver.

So let's look at the [Nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) service from port-forwarding excercise.
The server itself is of little use, if it cannot access our web content on the host.

We can define volumes with docker compose for the service like this:

```yml
services:
    nginx:
        image: nginx:latest
        volumes:
            - "./web_content:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro"
```

Where web_content folder is mapped to nginx html folder. `:ro` defines that it's read only.

Try to do the following:

1. Create folder `web_content`
2. Create index.html file under `web_content`
3. Modify html file
4. Restart the nginx service with compose

_*Q: What do you see now in the browser?*_

Now modify the index.html again and _do_ not restart the container.

_*Q: What do you see after you refresh the browser page?*_
