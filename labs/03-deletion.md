# Throw your container away

As containers are just a thin base layer on top of the host kernel, it is really fast to spin up a
new instance if you crashed your old one.

Let's try to run an alpine container and delete the file system.

Spin up the container with `docker run -ti alpine`

and then list all the folders on the root level to see the whole distribution:

``` bash
ls /
```

Expected output:

``` bash
bin    etc    lib    mnt    root   sbin   sys    usr
dev    home   media  proc   run    srv    tmp    var
```

List the current user:

``` bash
whoami
```

Expected output:

``` bash
root
```

List the current date:

``` bash
date
```

Expected output:

``` bash
Wed Aug 20 02:10:47 PM CEST 2025
```

> **Warning:** Make sure that you are inside your container. most likely you can see that by your
> command prompt showing `/ #` instead of `ubuntu@inst1:~/docker-katas/labs$`

Now, delete the binaries that the system is build up of with:

``` bash
rm -rf /bin
```

Try to navigate around to see how much of the OS is gone: try to run the `ls`, `whoami` and `date` commands.
They should all echo back that the binary is not found.

Exit out by pressing `Ctrl+d` and create a new instance of the Alpine image and look a bit around:

``` bash
docker run -it alpine
```

In the container run:

``` bash
ls /
```

Expected output:

``` bash
bin    etc    lib    mnt    root   sbin   sys    usr
dev    home   media  proc   run    srv    tmp    var
```

Try to perform the same tasks as displayed above to see that you have a fresh new instance ready to go.

## Auto-remove a container after use

Every time you create a new container, it will take up some space, even though it usually is minimal.
To see what your containers are taking up of space try to run the `docker container ls -as` command.

```bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                                                          NAMES               SIZE
4b09b2fe1d8c        alpine                    "/bin/sh"                7 seconds ago       Exited (1) 1 second ago                                                                    silly_jones         0B (virtual 3.97MB)
```

Here you can see that the alpine image itself takes 3.97MB, and the container itself takes 0B. When
you begin to manipulate files in your container, the size of the container will rise.

If you are creating a lot of new containers eg. to test something, you can tell the Docker daemon
to remove the container once stopped with the `--rm` option:
`docker run --rm -it alpine`

This will remove the container immediately after it is stopped.

## Cleaning up containers you do not use anymore

Containers are still persisted, even though they are stopped.
If you want to delete them from your server you can use the `docker rm` command.
`docker rm` can take either the `CONTAINER ID` or `NAME` as seen above.

Try to remove the `hello-world` container:

``` bash
 docker container ls -a
```

Expected output:

``` bash
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS                                                          NAMES
6a9246ff53cb        hello-world               "/hello"                 18 seconds ago      Exited (0) 16 seconds ago                                                                  ecstatic_cray
```

Delete the container:

``` bash
docker container rm ecstatic_cray
```

The name or ID specified is echoed back:

``` bash
ecstatic_cray
```

The container is now gone when you execute a `ls -a` command.

> :bulb: **Tip:** As with Git, you can use any unique part of the container ID to refer to it.

### Deleting images

You deleted the container instance above, but not the image of hello-world itself. And as you are
now on the verge to become a docker expert, you do not need the hello-world image anymore so let us
delete it.

First off, list all the images you have downloaded to your computer:

``` bash
docker image ls
```

Expected output:

``` bash
REPOSITORY                              TAG                   IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
alpine                                  latest                053cde6e8953        9 days ago          3.97MB
hello-world                             latest                48b5124b2768        10 months ago       1.84kB
```

Here you can see the images downloaded as well as their size.
To remove the hello-world image use the `docker image rm` command together with the id of the docker
image.

``` bash
docker image rm 48b5124b2768
```

Expected output:

``` bash
Untagged: hello-world:latest
Untagged: hello-world@sha256:c5515758d4c5e1e838e9cd307f6c6a0d620b5e07e6f927b07d05f6d12a1ac8d7
Deleted: sha256:48b5124b2768d2b917edcb640435044a97967015485e812545546cbed5cf0233
Deleted: sha256:98c944e98de8d35097100ff70a31083ec57704be0991a92c51700465e4544d08
```

What docker did here was to `untag` the image removing the references to the sha of the image.
After the image has no references, it deletes the two layers the image itself is comprised of.

### Cleaning up

When building, running and rebuilding images, you download and store a lot of layers. These layers
will not be deleted, as docker takes a very conservative approach to clean up.

Docker provides a `prune` command to clean up all dangling containers, images, networks, and volumes.

- `docker container prune`
- `docker image prune`
- `docker network prune`
- `docker volume prune`

The docker image prune command allows you to clean up unused images. By default, docker image prune
only cleans up dangling images. A dangling image is one that is not tagged and is not referenced by
any container. To remove all _unused_ resources, resources that are not directly used by any
existing containers, use the `-a` switch as well.

If you want a general cleanup, then `docker system prune` is your friend.

## Summary

You have now seen the swiftness of creating a new container from an image, trash it, and create a
new one on top of it.
You have learned to use `container rm` for deleting containers, `image rm` for images, `image ls`
for listing the images and `container ls -a` to look at all the containers on your host.
