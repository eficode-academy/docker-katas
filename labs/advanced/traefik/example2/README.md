# Traefik proxy running as independent docker compose app

In this example, Traefik runs as an independent docker compose application. For other applications
requiring it's "proxy" services, they need to be on the same network as of the Traefik proxy. The
best way is to make a docker bridge network ourselves, and connect all containers on that network.

## Create a docker bridge network - **services-network**

```bash
docker network create services-network
```

## Start Traefik - frond-end / proxy

Start the Traefik proxy service by briging up it's docker compose stack - which is compose of just
one container!

```bash
cd proxy
docker compose up -d
cd ..
```

Note: Please go through the actual `docker-compose.yml` and `traefik.toml` files under the `proxy` directory.

Verify:

```bash
docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
6665c2a9afb2        traefik:1.7                "/traefik"               7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   proxy_traefik_1
```

## Start the  web server - back-end

```bash
cd web
docker compose up -d
cd ..
```

Note: Please go through the actual `docker-compose.yml` file under the `web` directory.

Verify:

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
65b42f52017a        praqma/network-multitool   "/docker-entrypoint.…"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp      web_multitool_1
6665c2a9afb2        traefik:1.7                "/traefik"               7 minutes ago       Up 7 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   proxy_traefik_1
```

## Ensure DNS/name-resolution is in place

For this example, you can setup the following in your `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
$ cat /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain
127.0.0.1 example.com www.example.com

```

## Check with curl

```bash
curl example.com

Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - 65b42f52017a - 172.20.0.3/16

$ curl www.example.com

Praqma Network MultiTool (with NGINX) - 65b42f52017a - 172.20.0.3/16
```

Notice that `curl localhost` will not work, because the proxy is listening on localhost, on port 80,
expecting only the DNS names/URLs, which are configured as it's front-ends. It will ignore all other
urls , and will show a `404` .

```bash
curl localhost

404 page not found
```
