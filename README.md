This workshop will take you from "Hello Docker" to deploying a containerized web application to a server.

It's going to be a lot of fun!


## Prerequisites

You need to have access to a machine with docker installed.
There are many ways of getting that:
* Click the link above to get a Cloud shell from Google (require login)
* Docker installed on a linux box. 
* Docker desktop installed on a Mac or Windows machine.

## Philosophy


There are a few things you should know about this tutorial before we begin.

This tutorial is designed to be **self-paced** to make the most of your time.

The exercises won't always tell you exactly what you need to do.

Instead, it will point you to the right resources (like documentation and blog posts) to find the answer.
