# Docker Exercises


This workshop will take you from "Hello Docker" to deploying a containerized web application to a server.

It's going to be a lot of fun!


## Prerequisites

You need to have access to a linux box. Either your laptop or a cloud server.


## Philosophy


There are a few things you should know about this tutorial before we begin.


This tutorial is designed to be **self-paced** to make the most of your time.

The exercises won't always tell you exactly what you need to do.

Instead, it will point you to the right resources (like documentation and blog posts) to find the answer.

I prefer this approach because it helps prepare you to find answers about Docker questions *after* the tutorial is over.

## Getting help

All throughout the academy, we use *Slack*.

The chat room linked below should be used for general questions and comments about the tutorial:
